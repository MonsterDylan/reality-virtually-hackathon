# reality-virtually-hackathon
Repo for the GitHub workshop at the Reality Virtually Hackathon, MIT, January 17th, 2019

## Topics Covered

This workshop on Github will introduce participants to source control and best practices with Git.  Learn how to collaborate on a team and keep track of changes through a shared code repository.  The basics of Github will covered, such as file structure, code versioning, and branching off a main source. We'll go over how to pull, modify, commit, and merge code onto a master branch.  We will also review how to manage large files (audio, video, hi-res images) through GitHub's Large File Storage (LFS) system.  Students will have the option of using a command-line interface or GitHub's user-friendly GUI desktop application.  This workshop is for those new to source control and versioning, or looking to improve their git skills.

## Pre-requisites: Before the workshop, please check and download the following:

If you're completely new to Git, we recommend using a combination of Git Bash(#1) with GitHub Desktop(#2)

### 1) Do you have Git installed?  

On Windows:
Open the "Command Prompt" application and type:
`git --version`

On Mac: 
Open the "Terminal" application and type:
`git --version`

If you don't see a version number, download Git here: https://git-scm.com/download and follow these instructions:

In general, free free to follow the default settings during the Git installation process, EXCEPT for the following:

* (1/2)Install Git components on your desktop for easy access to Git Bash, as well as Git LFS (important for Step 4 (below)):

* (2/2)Install Git Bash (i.e, use MinTTY) if you've never used a Command Prompt(Windows) or Terminal(Mac) before:

### 2) Do you feel comfortable using the Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac)?  
If not, download GitHub Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/

You will use GitHub Desktop in conjunction with Git Bash(downloaded in Step 1) for Part 3 of this workshop.



### 3) Do you have a text editor?  
If not, we recommend SublimeText3: https://www.sublimetext.com/3

### 4) Do you have Git LFS installed?
If you installed Git in Step 1, LFS should already be installed.  If not, download the Git LFS extension here:
https://git-lfs.github.com/
