# reality-virtually-hackathon
Repo for the GitHub workshop at the Reality Virtually Hackathon, MIT, January 17th, 2019

## Topics Covered

This workshop on Github will introduce participants to source control and best practices with Git.  Learn how to collaborate on a team and keep track of changes through a shared code repository.  The basics of Github will covered, such as file structure, code versioning, and branching off a main source. We'll go over how to pull, modify, commit, and merge code onto a master branch.  We will also review how to manage large files (audio, video, hi-res images) through GitHub's Large File Storage (LFS) system.  Students will have the option of using a command-line interface or GitHub's user-friendly GUI desktop application.  This workshop is for those new to source control and versioning, or looking to improve their git skills.
